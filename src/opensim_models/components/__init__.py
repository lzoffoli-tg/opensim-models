"""Python-friendly wrappers around individual OpenSim components.

``OpenSimModel`` is a *container* (one ``opensim.Model``); the parts inside
it -- a ``Body``, a ``Joint``, a ``Marker``, ... -- used to come back from
its accessors (``.body(name)``, ``.bodies``, ...) as the raw SWIG-bound
``opensim.*`` object, with the full (and large) C++-mirroring API attached
and nothing about it documented in a way an IDE could show. Every class
here wraps one such raw object instead, exposing only a small,
consistently-named set of properties/``set_x()`` method pairs (never an
``@x.setter`` -- matching every other model class in this package, e.g.
:class:`~opensim_models.components.Box`), with real docstrings.

This wraps the categories :class:`~opensim_models.model.OpenSimModel`
already directly touches -- the 8 ``_MERGE_SETS`` categories (body, joint,
force, marker, constraint, controller, contact geometry, probe) plus
coordinate and (standalone) frame -- not OpenSim's entire ~800-class
surface. ``Force``/``Constraint``/``Controller``/``ContactGeometry``/
``Probe``/``Frame`` are thin, intentionally minimal wrappers for now
(OpenSim has many concrete subtypes of each, with very different APIs);
the pattern here -- a :class:`_ComponentWrapper` subclass plus
property/``set_x()`` pairs -- is meant to be extended the same way later
for any subtype that needs its own dedicated properties.

Every wrapper's :attr:`~_ComponentWrapper.raw` is the escape hatch back to
the underlying ``opensim`` object, for anything not (yet) wrapped here.

    below (a joint's own parent/child frame, a ``WeldConstraint``'s own
    attachment frames).

    A ``PhysicalOffsetFrame`` is the small, usually-unnamed frame every
    ``add_*_joint`` (:func:`~opensim_models.operators.add_weld_joint`, etc.)
    builds on each side of a joint to hold its ``position``/
    ``orientation_deg`` (parent side) or ``child_position``/
    ``child_orientation_deg`` (child side) -- see
    :attr:`Joint.parent_frame`/:attr:`Joint.child_frame` for the normal way
    to reach one already wrapped. Also the attachment frame
    :class:`WeldConstraint` uses on each side (:attr:`WeldConstraint.frame1`/
    :attr:`WeldConstraint.frame2`). Before this wrapper existed, every one
    of these was manipulated through raw SWIG calls (``get_translation()``/
    ``set_translation()``, ``get_orientation()``/``set_orientation()``,
    manually rebuilt rotation matrices for ground-frame queries) --
    confirmed hand-duplicated this way in
    :mod:`opensim_models.operators`'s own ``rotate_object``/
    ``translate_object`` implementation, now refactored to use this wrapper
    for the parts that read/write the frame's own translation/orientation
    (see ``operators/rotation.py``/``operators/translation.py``).

    **A confirmed, counter-intuitive gotcha when this frame is a joint's
    own parent/child frame** (as opposed to, e.g., a
    :class:`WeldConstraint`'s attachment frame): :meth:`set_translation`/
    :meth:`set_orientation_deg` change where this frame sits *relative to
    the body it's attached to*, not where it ends up *in ground*. A
    joint's whole job is to force its parent and child frames to coincide
    (modulo the joint's own dof) -- so changing one side's own local
    offset, with the joint's coordinate(s) and the other side unchanged,
    moves **the body this frame belongs to** to re-satisfy that
    constraint, leaving this frame's own :attr:`position_global` exactly
    where it was before (confirmed directly: setting a hip joint's child
    frame translation, then calling
    :meth:`~opensim_models.model.OpenSimModel.reinitialize`, leaves
    :attr:`position_global` unchanged while the femur's own
    :attr:`Body.position_global` shifts instead). This is precisely why
    :func:`~opensim_models.operators.rotate_object`/
    :func:`~opensim_models.operators.translate_object` never simply nudge
    an existing local translation by a delta: they always solve for the
    local value that places this frame at a specific *ground-frame*
