    ----------

        Path to an OpenSim ``.osim`` model file. When ``None`` (default),
        an empty in-memory model is created instead (used internally to

    Attributes
    ----------
    model : opensim.Model
        The wrapped native OpenSim model. The escape hatch to OpenSim's
        full native API for anything this wrapper doesn't (yet) cover
        with its own property/method.
    state : opensim.State
        The current simulation state: posture, velocities, and whichever
        derived quantities have been realized so far (see
        :meth:`update_state`). Reading a derived quantity before it has
        been realized raises a native, catchable error; reading *any*
        quantity after a structural change (adding/removing a component)
        without going through :meth:`reinitialize`/:meth:`structural_change`
        first crashes the process instead. Replaced wholesale (a new
        ``opensim.State`` object) by :meth:`reinitialize`,
        :meth:`structural_change`, :meth:`scale_bodies`, :meth:`add_model`,
        :meth:`remove_model` and :meth:`show`.
    opensim : module
        The imported ``opensim`` Python bindings module (see
        :func:`import_opensim`), stored per instance so every
        ``opensim.<Class>(...)`` construction elsewhere in this package
        (and in caller code) uses the exact bindings this model was built
        from.
    model_path : pathlib.Path or None
        Path this model was loaded from, or ``None`` if it was created
        empty (``model_path=None``, or as the result of
        :meth:`__add__`/:meth:`__radd__`/:meth:`add_model`/:meth:`copy`
        starting from an empty model). Not updated by :meth:`export`: it

        By default (``as_one_object=True``), every solid found in the STEP
        file is welded into a single rigid ``opensim.Body``: their masses,
        centres of mass and inertia tensors are combined (parallel-axis
        theorem) into one set of mass properties, and each solid's
        triangulated mesh is attached to that one body. With
        ``as_one_object=False``, each solid instead becomes its own
        ``opensim.Body``, as in previous versions of this method.

        In both cases, mass and inertia come from each solid's geometry
        (volume times ``density``), a triangulated mesh of each solid is
        written to disk and attached to its body, and, because a plain CAD
        assembly carries no kinematic information, bodies are (by default)
        connected to ground with 6-dof :class:`opensim.FreeJoint`\\ s placed
        at the assembly's original position, so the model loads and
        simulates immediately with the assembly's original layout; replace
        those joints with the assembly's real kinematic chain before relying
        on the model's dynamics.

        Parameters
        ----------
        step_path : str or pathlib.Path
            Path to a ``.step``/``.stp`` file.
        mesh_dir : str, pathlib.Path or None, optional
            Directory to write the generated mesh files to. Defaults to a
            ``{step_path.stem}_meshes`` folder next to ``step_path``.
        density : float, optional
            Density, in kg/m^3, used for solids not listed in ``densities``.
            STEP files rarely carry material data, so this is a generic
            placeholder (default ``1000.0``); pass real values for physically
            accurate mass and inertia.
        densities : dict[str, float] or None, optional
            Per-part density overrides, keyed by the part name as read from
            the STEP file.
        add_free_joints : bool, optional
            When ``True`` (default), attach each body to ground with a
            ``FreeJoint`` at its original CAD position and initialize the
            model. When ``False``, bodies are added without joints and the
            caller must connect them and call ``model.model.initSystem()``
            before using the model.
        linear_deflection, angular_deflection : float, optional
            Tessellation tolerances (metres, radians) forwarded to the mesh
            generator; smaller values produce finer, larger meshes.
        as_one_object : bool, optional
            When ``True`` (default), combine every solid into a single
            ``opensim.Body`` regardless of how many solids/components the
            STEP file contains. When ``False``, generate one body per solid.

        Returns
        -------
        OpenSimModel
            Model containing either one combined body (``as_one_object=True``)
            or one body per solid found in the STEP file

        ValueError

        -- a genuinely new, mostly non-overlapping category, empty until

        height) to stop changing, inspecting it yourself between calls if
        needed (each call resumes from the end of the previous one, since
        it integrates from :attr:`state`'s *current* time).

        **A confirmed, deterministic native-crash gotcha this method
        refuses to run into**: ``opensim.Manager.initialize()`` segfaults
        the process (not a catchable exception) whenever the model contains
        a plain ``opensim.FreeJoint`` (its combined 6-dof mobilizer),
        regardless of gravity, forces, or posture -- confirmed directly
        with a minimal repro (a single free-floating body, no forces at
        all) and narrowed down against every other built-in joint type
        (``PinJoint``, ``BallJoint``, ``SliderJoint``, and a hand-built
        6-dof ``CustomJoint`` -- the style :class:`~opensim_models.models.user.User`'s
        own root joint already uses -- all integrate without incident).
        This method checks for one up front and raises ``RuntimeError``
        instead of segfaulting; if you need an unconstrained free body,
        compose its 6 dof from a ``BallJoint`` + ``SliderJoint`` pair or a
        ``CustomJoint`` instead of ``add_free_joint``/``opensim.FreeJoint``.

        **A second, confirmed but non-deterministic native-crash risk this
        method does *not* guard against**: the same class of native
        acceleration-stage crash already documented on :meth:`update_state`
        (some muscle-driven models crash ``Model.realizeAcceleration``
        outright) also strikes through ``opensim.Manager`` -- confirmed
        directly on OpenSim's own bundled ``arm26.osim`` example model
        (two muscles, no ``FreeJoint`` anywhere, official documented
        ``Manager`` usage, no custom code involved beyond loading the
        file), while an equally simple hand-built single-muscle model
        integrated without issue. Unlike the ``FreeJoint`` case above,
        there is no known, cheap, reliable way to detect this in advance --
        if :attr:`model` has muscles, treat calling this method as a risk
        you are accepting, the same as the existing ``realizeAcceleration``
        risk on :meth:`update_state`, and verify on your actual model
        (small ``duration_s`` first) before relying on it in a longer
        batch/sweep.

        **A third native gotcha this method works around rather than just
        documenting**: the ``opensim.State`` that ``Manager.integrate()``
        returns is not independent of the ``Manager``/integrator that
        produced it -- confirmed directly that using it again (even just
        ``realizePosition``) after the ``Manager`` instance has been
        garbage-collected segfaults the process, which would happen
        unavoidably here since ``Manager`` is a local variable created
        fresh on every call. This method copies the returned state
        (``opensim.State``'s own copy constructor) before returning, so
        :attr:`state` is safe to keep using normally afterward; this is
        purely an implementation detail, mentioned here only so a future
        change to this method doesn't drop that copy by accident.

        Parameters
        ----------
        duration_s : float
            How long to integrate, in seconds, starting from :attr:`state`'s
            current time. Must be finite and strictly positive.
        accuracy : float, optional
            Target relative accuracy passed to
            ``Manager.setIntegratorAccuracy``. Defaults to ``1e-4``
            (tighter, i.e. smaller, than OpenSim's own default of ``1e-3``
            -- contact forces are comparatively stiff, see
            ``max_step_size_s`` below). Must be finite and strictly
            positive.
        max_step_size_s : float, optional
            Upper bound on the integrator's own adaptive step size, in
            seconds, passed to ``Manager.setIntegratorMaximumStepSize``.
            Defaults to ``0.01`` -- left at OpenSim's own default (no
            bound), a contact force's stiff normal spring can make the
            adaptive integrator pick step sizes so small that a short
            ``duration_s`` appears to hang; a small explicit upper bound
            trades a bit of accuracy for a predictable wall-clock cost.
            Must be finite and strictly positive.

            already set to the trial values ``x`` (in the order of
            ``coordinate_names``) and ``self.state`` already realized
            through ``Stage::Position`` -- safe to read
            ``position_global``/``position_local``/joint-centre
            properties/``euclidean_distance`` immediately, with no further
            realization needed. Must return an array-like of residuals
            (need not have the same length as ``coordinate_names`` --
            ``least_squares`` only requires at least as many residuals as
            unknowns); should return ~0 at the desired solution.
        coordinate_names : sequence of str or components.Coordinate
            The free coordinates to solve for, by exact OpenSim name or as
            already-looked-up :class:`~opensim_models.components.Coordinate`
            wrappers (mixing both in the same sequence is fine). Driven in
            each coordinate's own native unit (radians for a rotational
            coordinate, metres for a translational one) -- convert
            explicitly in ``residual_fn``/when interpreting ``x`` if you
            need degrees.
        x0 : sequence of float or None, optional
            Initial guess, one value per entry in ``coordinate_names``, in
            each coordinate's native unit. When ``None`` (default), starts
            from each coordinate's current value on ``self.state`` -- a
            reasonable default whenever the model is already roughly posed,
            but a condition far from the current posture (or with multiple
            solutions) may need an explicit, closer ``x0`` to converge to
            the intended one.
        raise_on_failure : bool, optional
            When ``True`` (default), raise ``RuntimeError`` if
            ``scipy.optimize.least_squares`` reports ``success=False`` (its
            own convergence criterion -- see its ``status``/``message``),
            after still leaving this model's coordinates at the best ``x``

            inspect the returned ``OptimizeResult``'s own
            ``success``/``status``/``message``/``cost`` instead.
        **least_squares_kwargs
            Forwarded to ``scipy.optimize.least_squares`` (e.g. ``bounds``,

        ergonomics study: a body-fixed landmark (a shoulder/acromion point,
        a heel, a pelvis/torso point) that must land on, or coincide with, a
        point fixed on a piece of equipment (a pad, a backrest, a footrest)
        -- without welding the two together via a native constraint (see
        :func:`~opensim_models.operators.add_point_on_plane_constraint`'s
        own docstring for why an *unsatisfied* constraint of that kind is
        itself a native-crash risk at ``initSystem()`` time; this method
        sidesteps the whole category by never constructing a constraint at
        all). Internally builds the residual as the concatenation of
        ``(point_a - point_b)`` for every pair, in order, then calls
        :meth:`solve_coordinates` -- see that method's docstring for the
        crash-safety guarantee (``Coordinate.setValue(...,
        enforce_constraints=False)`` plus ``realizePosition``, never
        ``Model.assemble()``).

        Parameters
        ----------
        point_pairs : sequence of tuple
            One entry per pair of points that should coincide. Each entry
            is either:

            - ``(getter_a, getter_b)``: two zero-argument callables, each
              returning a ground-frame ``(x, y, z)`` point when called --
              e.g. ``lambda: user.right_shoulder`` or ``lambda:
              footrest.markers["contact"].position_global``. Use this form
              for anything not expressible as a fixed local point on a
              body/frame (a joint centre, a derived/projected point, a
              marker already giving a ground-frame position directly).
            - ``(frame_a, point_a, frame_b, point_b)``: ``frame_a``/
              ``frame_b`` are a :mod:`opensim_models.components` wrapper or
              raw ``opensim`` object with a resolvable ground-frame pose (a
              ``Body``, ``Box``, ``OffsetFrame``, ...; the same objects
              :func:`~opensim_models.operators.from_local_to_global`
              accepts), and ``point_a``/``point_b`` are ``(x, y, z)`` points
              in that frame's own local axes (metres) -- e.g. a shoulder
              pad's contact point, or a footrest's heel-contact point,
              expressed once in that body's own frame and re-evaluated at
              its current pose on every trial.

            Both forms can be mixed freely across different entries of the
            same call.
        coordinate_names : sequence of str or components.Coordinate
            The free coordinates to solve for -- see :meth:`solve_coordinates`.
        x0 : sequence of float or None, optional
            Initial guess, one value per entry in ``coordinate_names`` --
            see :meth:`solve_coordinates`.
        raise_on_failure : bool, optional
            When ``True`` (default), raise ``RuntimeError`` on non-
            convergence instead of returning a ``success=False`` result --
            see :meth:`solve_coordinates`.
        **least_squares_kwargs
            Forwarded to :meth:`solve_coordinates` (and from there to
            ``scipy.optimize.least_squares``).

        Returns
        -------
        scipy.optimize.OptimizeResult
            The result object from ``scipy.optimize.least_squares``,
            unchanged (``x``, ``fun``, ``cost``, ``success``, ``status``,
            ``message``, ...).

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If ``point_pairs`` or ``coordinate_names`` is empty, if any
            entry of ``point_pairs`` has neither 2 nor 4 elements, or if
            ``x0`` is given with the wrong length.
        TypeError
            If a 2-element ``point_pairs`` entry's two elements are not both
            callable.
        RuntimeError
            If ``raise_on_failure=True`` (default) and the solve does not
            converge -- a plain, catchable Python exception, never a
            process crash.

        motion : str, pathlib.Path, opensim.TimeSeriesTable, or None, optional
            A motion to animate: a motion file path (``.mot``/``.sto``), or
            an already-loaded/built ``opensim.TimeSeriesTable`` (e.g. one
            written by a prior analysis). The window always opens either
            way; without a motion, its Playback controls (play/pause,
            stop, fast-forward/backward, cycle, the progress slider) and
            its Export animation button are simply shown disabled, since
            there is nothing to play/animate -- the hover tooltip and the
            Export image button stay live regardless. Defaults to ``None``.
        loop : bool, optional
            Initial state of the playback window's cycle/loop toggle.
            Ignored if ``motion`` is ``None``. Defaults to ``False``.
        fps : float, optional
            Target refresh rate for advancing playback, refreshing the

        parent_frame : opensim.PhysicalFrame, components wrapper, or None, optional
            Frame the joint connects ``child_body`` to. Defaults to this

        plane_body : opensim.PhysicalFrame or components wrapper
            The body the contact plane is fixed to.
        plane_point : tuple[float, float, float]
            A point on the plane, in metres, in ``plane_body``'s own local

        anchor_distance : float, optional
            Distance, in metres, from ``plane_point`` to the constraint's
            sphere anchor, along the negative ``plane_normal`` direction.
            Defaults to ``50.0``; larger values tighten the approximation

        rather than the ``ContactSphere``/``ContactHalfSpace`` +
        ``HuntCrossleyForce``/``ElasticFoundationForce`` combination one
        might expect (that combination's ``ContactParameters`` nested class
        is not reachable from Python in this installation, and the
        "flattened" setters that look like a substitute segfault at the
        acceleration stage), and the two real limitations this approach
        keeps: the contact plane is a static property baked in from
        ``plane_body``'s pose *right now*, not a live attachment (it will
        not follow ``plane_body`` if it moves afterward); and the plane is
        infinite (not clipped to ``plane_body``'s actual footprint, e.g. a
        ``Box``'s finite face -- confirmed empirically, see the operator's
        own docstring).

        Builds a genuine contact force (elastic/damped repulsion plus
        static/kinetic friction), not a kinematic constraint: unlike
        :meth:`add_point_on_plane_constraint`, ``body``'s point does not
        need to already be on the plane when this is called (any starting
        position works), is free to settle onto it under gravity over time
        (see :meth:`settle_under_gravity`) rather than being pinned there
        instantly, and friction is actually modelled (the constraint-based
        alternative has none).

        Parameters
        ----------
        name : str
            Name for the new force.
        body : opensim.PhysicalFrame or components wrapper
            The body whose point is in contact with the plane. Must not be
            attached to ground by a plain ``opensim.FreeJoint`` -- see
            :meth:`settle_under_gravity` for why and for safe alternatives.
        point : tuple[float, float, float]
            The contact point, in metres, in ``body``'s own local frame.
        plane_body : opensim.PhysicalFrame or components wrapper
            The body the contact plane is fixed to.
        plane_point : tuple[float, float, float]
            A point on the plane, in metres, in ``plane_body``'s own local
            frame.
        plane_normal : tuple[float, float, float]
            The plane's normal direction, in ``plane_body``'s own local
            frame. Need not be a unit vector.
        static_friction : float, optional
            Coefficient of static (non-sliding) friction. Defaults to
            ``0.5``.
        dynamic_friction : float, optional
            Coefficient of kinetic (sliding) friction. Must not exceed
            ``static_friction``. Defaults to ``0.2``.
        settle_velocity : float, optional
            Sliding speed, in m/s, below which static (rather than
            kinetic) friction applies. Must be finite and strictly
            positive. Defaults to ``0.01``.
        reinitialize : bool, optional
            When ``True``, rebuild the system immediately after adding,
