    """An ANSUR-based anthropometric user backed by an OpenSim model.

    Built from the Rajagopal-Lai-Uhlrich full-body OpenSim model
    (``rajagopalaiulrich2023.osim``, bundled under ``assets/``), scaled
    per-body to the requested anthropometry using ANSUR II reference data
    (see "Scaling antropometrico" in the package README), then calibrated
    so the model's total mass matches a real anthropometric mass reference
    (``mass_kg``, if given, otherwise the resolved ANSUR ``weight_kg`` --
    see :attr:`mass_kg`) rather than whatever the geometric scaling alone
    produces volumetrically; unlike every other anthropometric parameter
    here, total mass can also be recalibrated after construction, via
    :meth:`set_mass_kg`. Every joint angle
    is exposed through a ``set_<joint>_<motion>``/``<joint>_<motion>``
    setter/getter pair (see the posture methods further below), and every
    major joint centre, segment length, and ANSUR-derived body measurement
    is exposed as a read-only property.

    Parameters
    ----------
    gender : str | Literal['M', 'F']
        Sex code used to select the ANSUR II reference population. Must be
        exactly ``"M"`` or ``"F"`` (case-sensitive, no other values
        accepted).
    height_cm : float or None, optional
        Requested stature, in centimetres. If provided, every anthropometric
        measurement (stature included) is resolved directly from this
        height via a per-measurement PCHIP regression against the ANSUR
        subjects of the requested ``gender``, and takes precedence over
        ``percentile`` (which is still computed afterwards, purely for
        information -- see :attr:`percentile`). A height outside the ANSUR
        range observed for that gender is not rejected: it is extrapolated
        (PCHIP with linear tails) and raises a :class:`UserWarning`, with
        extrapolation reliability dropping the further the requested height
        is from the observed range.
    percentile : float, optional
        Common ANSUR percentile applied to every numeric measurement when
        ``height`` is not provided. Defaults to ``50.0``. Must lie in the
        inclusive interval ``[0.1, 99.9]``; this applies ``numpy.percentile``
        independently per measurement (no single reference subject is
        selected, and no interpolation is performed across different
        measurements).
    mass_kg : float or None, optional
        Requested total body mass, in kilograms. If provided, it is used
        as an *independent* scaling input, exactly like ``height_cm``: once
        every body has been scaled geometrically (see "Scaling
        antropometrico" in the README), every body's mass *and* inertia
        tensor are uniformly rescaled (a single scalar factor, via
        ``opensim.Body.scaleMass``) so the whole model's total mass
        (``self.model.getTotalMass(self.state)``) matches ``mass_kg`` exactly --
        independent of whatever the height-driven geometric scaling alone
        would have produced volumetrically. If not provided (the default),
        the same rescaling is still applied, but targeting the ANSUR
        ``weight_kg`` resolved for this user's height/percentile (see
        :attr:`anthropometry`) -- i.e. mass is always resolved "like the
        other measurements" (from height when given, via
        :func:`~opensim_models.models.user._data.resolve_reference`),
        never left as a pure side effect of geometric scaling. See
        :attr:`mass_kg` to read back the resolved value either way.
    dataset : str or pathlib.Path, optional
        Path to the ANSUR II reference CSV to resolve measurements from.
        Defaults to the dataset bundled with this package.
    model_path : str or pathlib.Path, optional
        Path to the OpenSim ``.osim`` model file to load and scale.
        Defaults to the bundled Rajagopal-Lai-Uhlrich model.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``gender`` is not ``"M"``/``"F"``, if ``height`` is given but is
        not a positive finite number, if ``percentile`` is not finite or
        falls outside ``[0.1, 99.9]``, or if ``mass_kg`` is given but is not
        a positive finite number.
