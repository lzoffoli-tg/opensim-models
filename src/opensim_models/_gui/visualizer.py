"""An in-process, interactive VTK visualizer for an ``OpenSimModel``.

Replaces the native Simbody visualizer (``opensim.ModelVisualizer``) that
:meth:`~opensim_models.model.OpenSimModel.show` used to open: that
visualizer runs as a *separate process* (a bundled ``simbody-visualizer``
executable) communicating over a pipe, and its own
``Visualizer.InputListener`` interface exposes exactly three callbacks --
``keyPressed``, ``menuSelected``, ``sliderMoved`` -- with no mouse-move/
hover event, no camera-transform getter (only a setter, and the user can
freely orbit/pan/zoom with the mouse, which is never reported back), and
no picking/ray-intersection API at all. There is therefore no way to know
where the mouse is over that window, or what is under it.

VTK's ``vtkRenderWindowInteractor``, by contrast, runs *in this same
process*: its ``MouseMoveEvent`` fires here, its camera transform is
always readable, and ``vtkCellPicker`` resolves a screen pixel to both a
3D world point and the actor under it -- exactly what a live coordinate/
component readout needs. The tradeoff is reimplementing geometry loading
(meshes and the native ``Brick``/``Cylinder``/``Sphere`` primitives) and
visuals that the Simbody visualizer provided for free; this module covers
only what :meth:`OpenSimModel.show` and the playback window
(:mod:`opensim_models._gui.player`) actually need.

The interactor's own blocking ``Start()`` event loop is never used: it runs
a native Win32 message loop in C++ that does not release the GIL, so even
on its own background thread it stalls every other Python thread in the
process (confirmed directly -- a plain
``threading.Thread(target=interactor.Start).start()`` hangs the calling
thread's very next line). Instead, :meth:`VTKVisualizer.process_events`
wraps ``vtkRenderWindowInteractor.ProcessEvents()``, a single non-blocking
pump of pending window messages; :mod:`opensim_models._gui.player` calls it
once per tick of its own Tk ``after()`` loop, on the same thread as Tk's
event processing, so one thread drives both GUIs without contention.

For the same reason, a ``VTKVisualizer`` must be *constructed* on that
same thread too, not handed over from another one afterward: its native
window is thread-affine (a plain Win32 rule -- a window's messages are
only ever delivered to the thread that created it), and
:mod:`opensim_models._gui.player` additionally reparents that window into its
own Tk frame, a call that blocks waiting for the *creating* thread to
process it -- which deadlocks if that thread is the caller's and has
already moved on past ``show()``, as confirmed directly. ``_player.py``'s
``start_player`` is therefore what constructs every ``VTKVisualizer``,
never :meth:`~opensim_models.model.OpenSimModel.show` itself.

A pure-white actor on a near-white background looks exactly like a blank/
broken render at a glance -- confirmed the hard way, chasing a GL-context
red herring across several reparenting-timing variants before noticing
the *background* was rendering correctly all along and only the
(uncoloured, default-white) actor itself was invisible against it.
:meth:`_add_body_actors` sets an explicit material colour for exactly
this reason -- it is a visibility fix, not a cosmetic one.

    A thin remap of ``vtkInteractorStyleTrackballCamera``'s own modifier ->
    action dispatch (which already reserves Shift+left for Pan and plain
    Ctrl+left for Spin): a Ctrl-held left-drag is presented to the base
    implementation as if Shift were held instead (and Ctrl released),
    since that is the branch it already treats as Pan -- reusing its own
    ``FindPokedRenderer``/``GrabFocus``/``StartPan`` machinery rather than
    reimplementing it. The real modifier state is restored immediately
    after, since the base class's ``OnMouseMove``/``OnLeftButtonUp`` only
    ever dispatch off ``State`` (set by ``StartPan``/``StartRotate``
    during ``OnLeftButtonDown``), never by re-reading modifier keys
    themselves mid-drag. Plain rotate and mouse-wheel zoom are left as the
    base class's own default behaviour unchanged -- which already does
    nothing on a plain click (rotation amount comes purely from mouse-move
    delta while the button is down, so zero movement is zero rotation).

        (an added/removed body) with a new ``VTKVisualizer`` instead --
        this one's actors are fixed at construction time.
    embed : callable or None, optional
        If given, called once, with this visualizer's native window
        handle (:meth:`get_window_id`'s value), after the window exists
        but before its first paint -- :mod:`opensim_models._gui.player`
        passes a callback that reparents it into its own Tk frame right
        then.
    offscreen : bool, optional
        Render without creating an interactive render-window interactor.
        Used by :func:`opensim_models.save_animation` to export video
        without opening a window. Defaults to ``False``.
