"""The unified viewer+playback window for an ``OpenSimModel``.

Used by :meth:`~opensim_models.model.OpenSimModel.show`: opens a single Tk
window embedding the (VTK-based, see :mod:`opensim_models._gui.visualizer`)
3D view in its upper area, with three groups of controls below it:

- Playback (play/pause, stop, fast-forward, fast-backward, a loop/cycle
  toggle, and a draggable progress slider) driving a motion loaded via
  ``show(motion=...)`` -- disabled whenever no motion is loaded, rather
  than the controls disappearing, so there is always somewhere to look
  for them.
- View (ground/muscles/markers visibility toggles, and a preset-camera
  dropdown) -- unlike the playback controls, never disabled, since these
  act on the 3D view itself rather than a loaded motion.
- Export (save the current view as a PNG, or a loaded motion as an MP4 --
  see :mod:`opensim_models._gui.export`); the animation button is disabled
  under the same condition as the playback controls, since there is
  nothing to animate without a loaded motion.

A floating tooltip (:class:`~opensim_models._gui.tooltip.HoverTooltip`) is
shown next to the mouse cursor whenever it is over a piece of geometry,
with the hovered component's name and ground-frame position.

This used to be two separate windows (the native 3D view plus a Tk window
kept docked under it), from when this project drove the *native* Simbody
visualizer (a separate process) and the only way to add playback/status
chrome to it at all was a second, independent window -- Simbody's own
widget API (``Visualizer.addSlider``/``addMenu``/``setWindowTitle`` --
anything taking a ``SimTK::String``) is not callable from Python on at
least some OpenSim builds. The visualizer is no longer Simbody's, and
runs in this same process now, so its native window is instead reparented
(Windows only -- see :mod:`opensim_models._gui.win32_embed`) directly into
a frame inside this one Tk window: one window, no inter-window docking to
keep in sync.

Embedding was briefly suspected of corrupting VTK's OpenGL context (a
blank window, logging ``wglMakeCurrent failed ... resource is in use``)
and reverted to the two-window design once -- that diagnosis was wrong.
The window was never blank: its actors had no material colour set, so
VTK's default (plain white) rendered indistinguishably from the
near-white background underneath real geometry that was there all along,
proven by sampling actual pixel values on and off the actor rather than
eyeballing a screenshot. :meth:`~opensim_models._gui.visualizer.VTKVisualizer._add_body_actors`
now sets an explicit colour for exactly this reason. The
``wglMakeCurrent`` log lines turned out to be unrelated, triggered by
*this project's own test scripts* calling VTK interactor methods directly
from a thread other than the one that created the window while chasing
the (nonexistent) embedding bug -- not something a real caller, driving
input through the OS's normal per-thread message dispatch, would ever
hit.

This module's ``start_player`` still constructs ``model``'s
:class:`~opensim_models._gui.visualizer.VTKVisualizer` itself (setting
:attr:`~opensim_models.model.OpenSimModel.visualizer`), on the same
background thread that runs this window and calls
:meth:`~opensim_models._gui.visualizer.VTKVisualizer.process_events`
every tick: a Win32 window's messages are only ever delivered to the
thread that created it, so both the embedding reparent call and every
later ``process_events()`` pump need to happen on that same thread.

        :class:`MotionData`. When ``None`` (default), the window still
        opens (with its hover tooltip and Export image button live), but
        the playback controls and the Export animation button are shown
        disabled, since there is nothing to play/animate.
    loop : bool, optional
        Initial state of the cycle/loop toggle. Ignored if ``motion`` is
        ``None``. Defaults to ``False``.
    fps : float, optional
        Target refresh rate for advancing playback, refreshing the
        tooltip, and redrawing the visualizer, in frames per second; also
        the frame rate of an exported animation (see :mod:`opensim_models._gui.export`).
